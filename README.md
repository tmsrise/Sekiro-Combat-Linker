# Sekiro-Combat-Linker

An old playground project that is a precursor to the weapon wheel. As I did most of my initial learning on this project, and used it more like a scratch pad for testing, there is no organization. It also includes random files from other repos that I was looking at for guidance.

This variant was never released, but added 3 combat arts and dynamic switching very similar to the normal prosthetic switching. I do not recommend attempting to build/use it. There might be some resources missing like images and fonts.
